# Piano-Keys Interactive Game

Welcome to the **Piano-Keys Interactive Game** project! In this project, we've created an interactive piano game for a music education company. The purpose of this project is to provide a fun and engaging way for beginner-level piano students to study and practice their piano skills. The interactive piano player is built using JavaScript's DOM events and utilizes a combination of key presses and button clicks to play and progress through a musical composition.

## Project Overview

The Piano-Keys Interactive Game features an interactive piano player interface and a musical composition to be played. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

- **Interactive Piano:** The piano keys are represented visually on the webpage, and users can interact with them by clicking or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. Each key changes color when clicked or pressed, simulating the experience of playing a piano.

- **Musical Composition:** The game presents a musical composition that users can play by clicking on the piano keys in the correct sequence. The composition progresses in stages, and users advance through the composition by clicking on "next line" buttons.

- **Event Handling:** The `main.js` file contains event handlers for various interactions, such as key presses, key releases, and button clicks. These event handlers change the color of the piano keys and update the displayed lyrics.

## How to Play

To play the Piano-Keys Interactive Game, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. The piano keys are displayed on the left side of the screen. Click on the keys using your mouse or use the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play the piano.

3. As you play the correct notes, the lyrics will progress on the right side of the screen.

4. Click the "next line" buttons at the bottom of the lyrics section to advance through the musical composition.

5. Continue clicking keys and "next line" buttons to complete the composition.

6. To start over, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of the lyrics section.

## Technologies Used

The Piano-Keys Interactive Game is developed using the following technologies:

- HTML: For creating the structure of the interactive piano and lyrics section.
- CSS: For styling the visual elements of the interactive piano and lyrics.
- JavaScript: For implementing the interactive features, event handling, and gameplay logic.
